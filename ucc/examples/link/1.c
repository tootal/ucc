/**

	Undeclared fabs250()
		is treated as 	int fabs250() 	----without prototype
		in C Language
	(1) In UCC(see 1.s and 2.s)
		Before calling fabs250(...) in main(),
		we mov the address of "%x \n" to %eax,
		During the execution of fabs250(..),
		it happens to be that %eax is untouched.
		After fabs250(...), %eax is still the address
		of "%x \n".
	(2) In GCC(see 1.s and 2.s),
		the content of %eax is changed during fabs250(...).
		But because fabs250(...) is also considered as no-prototype,
		we do argument-promotion here,
		8.0f ---->  0x00000000	0x40200000.
		But when REAL_T is float,
		float fabs250(float val) only fetch the first 4 byes in 
		the stack ,that is , 0x00000000.
		So after fabs250(...), %eax is still 0.
